# Improved Favorites Sync System

## Overview

The favorites sync system has been completely redesigned to handle different user scenarios intelligently, providing a robust offline-first experience with seamless cloud synchronization.

## Key Features

### 1. Offline-First Architecture

- **Always local first**: All favorite operations (add/remove) are immediately saved to local storage
- **Immediate UI feedback**: Users see changes instantly regardless of network status
- **No data loss**: Local changes are preserved even if cloud sync fails

### 2. Smart Scenario Handling

#### Scenario 1: User Not Authenticated

- **Behavior**: Only local storage is used
- **Sync**: No cloud synchronization
- **Data**: Favorites remain on device only

#### Scenario 2: User Authenticated + Offline

- **Behavior**: Local storage + pending operations queue
- **Sync**: Operations are queued for later sync
- **Data**: Changes are stored locally and synced when back online

#### Scenario 3: User Authenticated + Online

- **Behavior**: Local storage + immediate cloud sync
- **Sync**: Bidirectional synchronization
- **Data**: Local and cloud data are kept in sync

### 3. Bidirectional Sync Logic

When syncing (user authenticated + online):

1. **Process pending operations**: Execute any queued add/remove operations
2. **Sync local-only items**: Add local favorites that don't exist in cloud
3. **Sync cloud-only items**: Add cloud favorites that don't exist locally
4. **Conflict resolution**: Local data takes precedence for immediate operations

## Technical Implementation

### New Services

#### 1. ConnectivityService

- **Purpose**: Monitor network connectivity status
- **Features**: Real-time connectivity detection, stream-based updates
- **Dependencies**: `connectivity_plus` package

#### 2. PendingOperationsService

- **Purpose**: Queue operations for later sync when offline
- **Features**: Persistent storage, operation tracking, automatic cleanup
- **Storage**: SharedPreferences for persistence

### Updated Services

#### 1. HybridFavoritesRepository

- **Enhanced Logic**: Scenario-based operation handling
- **Pending Operations**: Integration with pending operations service
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Smart sync between local and cloud data
- **Connectivity Awareness**: Real-time network status monitoring

#### 2. FavoritesSyncService

- **Connectivity Monitoring**: Listens to network changes
- **Smart Sync**: Triggers sync when back online
- **Authentication Handling**: Manages sync based on auth state

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Favorite

```dart
// This works in all scenarios
await hybridRepository.addToFavorites(hymn);

// Scenario 1 (Not authenticated): Saved locally only
// Scenario 2 (Authenticated + Offline): Saved locally + queued for sync
// Scenario 3 (Authenticated + Online): Saved locally + synced immediately
```

### Removing a Favorite

```dart
// This works in all scenarios
await hybridRepository.removeFromFavorites(hymnNumber);

// Scenario 1 (Not authenticated): Removed locally only
// Scenario 2 (Authenticated + Offline): Removed locally + queued for sync
// Scenario 3 (Authenticated + Online): Removed locally + synced immediately
```

### Checking Sync Status

```dart
final status = await hybridRepository.getSyncStatus();
print('Local favorites: ${status['localCount']}');
print('Cloud favorites: ${status['firestoreCount']}');
print('Pending operations: ${status['pendingOperationsCount']}');
print('Is online: ${status['isOnline']}');
print('Is authenticated: ${status['isAuthenticated']}');
print('Is synced: ${status['isSynced']}');
```

## Benefits

### 1. User Experience

- **Instant feedback**: Changes appear immediately
- **Offline capability**: Full functionality without internet
- **Seamless sync**: Automatic synchronization when possible
- **No data loss**: All changes are preserved

### 2. Reliability

- **Network resilience**: Handles connectivity issues gracefully
- **Error recovery**: Failed operations are retried automatically
- **Data consistency**: Bidirectional sync ensures data integrity
- **Conflict resolution**: Smart handling of data conflicts

### 3. Performance

- **Offline-first**: No waiting for network operations
- **Efficient sync**: Only syncs when necessary
- **Background processing**: Sync happens transparently
- **Minimal battery usage**: Optimized for mobile devices

## Migration

The new system is backward compatible. Existing local favorites will be preserved and synced when the user authenticates and comes online.

## Configuration

### Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  connectivity_plus: ^6.0.5
```

### Initialization

The system is automatically initialized in `main.dart`:

```dart
await ConnectivityService().initialize();
await FavoritesSyncService().initialize();
```

## Monitoring

### Logs

The system provides comprehensive logging for debugging:

- Connectivity changes
- Sync operations
- Pending operations
- Error conditions

### Status Tracking

Real-time status information is available for UI updates and debugging.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conflict Resolution**: More sophisticated conflict resolution strategies
2. **Sync Analytics**: Detailed sync performance metrics
3. **Selective Sync**: User-controlled sync preferences
4. **Batch Operations**: Optimized bulk sync operations
5. **Sync Scheduling**: Configurable sync intervals
