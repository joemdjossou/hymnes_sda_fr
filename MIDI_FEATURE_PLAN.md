- Support for standard MIDI format files

### Error Handling

- Graceful handling of missing MIDI files
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback options when playback fails

## Development Roadmap

## User Experience

### Current Experience

1. User opens hymn detail screen
2. MIDI player widget displays with hymn information
3. User taps "All Voices" to play complete MIDI file
4. Player shows progress and provides basic controls
5. Individual voice buttons show "Coming Soon" message

### Future Experience

## File Management

### MIDI File Requirements

- Standard MIDI format (.mid files)
- Preferably 4-channel arrangement (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass)
- Consistent naming convention for easy identification
- Reasonable file sizes for mobile app distribution

### Asset Organization

```
assets/
  midi/
    h001.mid  # Hymn 1
    h002.mid  # Hymn 2
    ...
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current Optimizations

- Lazy loading of MIDI files
- Efficient memory management
- Smooth UI updates during playback

### Future Optimizations

- Caching of parsed MIDI data
- Background processing for voice separation
- Optimized audio rendering for multiple tracks

This implementation provides a solid foundation for MIDI playback while maintaining a clear path for future enhancements.
